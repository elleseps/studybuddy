                <h2>THE POMODORO METHOD</h2>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
                    traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as
                    "Pomodoros". After four Pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30 minutes is taken. The idea behind the technique is to
                    use the time pressure of the timer to increase focus and productivity. The method has been widely
                    adopted as a tool to help people stay focused and get things done. It can be used for studying, working, or completing
                    any task that requires concentration.</p>

                    timer bellow. Set the timer and get to work. U got this! Don't forget
                    to take small breaks in between that's important too. You can also use the timer for this.
